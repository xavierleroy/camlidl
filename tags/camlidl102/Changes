CamlIDL 1.02:
-------------

* Added support for the "long long", "hyper int" and "__int64" types
  (64-bit C integers)
* Added support for "const" modifier on pointer types
* Support for [unique] attribute on big arrays, turned into option types
  in the Caml interface
* Generated C code should now compile cleanly with a C++ compiler
* Print source location for most warnings
* Error location was sometimes way off; this is now fixed
* Fixed incorrect code generated for the types HRESULT_int and HRESULT_bool
* Fixed refcount management bug causing early deallocation of interfaces
  implemented in Caml.


CamlIDL 1.01:
-------------

* Added support for Caml boxed int types (int32, int64, nativeint)
  and for big arrays (module Bigarray)
* Fixed bug in allocation of working space for out parameters
  of array types.
* Disambiguation of record labels that belong to several struct types.
* Support for [unique] attribute on strings and arrays, turned into
  option types in the Caml interface.
* Fixed bug with anonymous enum types (forgot to define the
  corresponding translation table).
* Fixed bug with dependent parameters depending on out parameters
  (these must not be omitted in the Caml function declaration).
* "in,out" parameters of type string or big array are now presented
  as an "in,out" parameter of the Caml function and modified in place,
  rather than presented as a parameter and a result.
* Added minimal support for COM dispatch interfaces.
* Fixed lack of initialization of ignored pointers for structs with
  only one significant field.
* Relicensed under the QPL (for the compiler) and the LGPL (for
  everything else).


CamlIDL 1.00:
-------------

First public release.
